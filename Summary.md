### Summary

1. **Deep Learning in Statistical Arbitrage (US Equities)**:
   - This paper develops a novel machine learning framework for statistical arbitrage in the U.S. equity markets. It uses convolutional transformers to extract arbitrage signals and optimize trading decisions, achieving high Sharpe ratios and consistent profits. The approach integrates deep learning models to improve signal detection and arbitrage portfolio construction.

2. **Statistical Arbitrage on the JSE (Johannesburg Stock Exchange)**:
   - This paper explores statistical arbitrage on the JSE using a partial co-integration approach. It implements a Kalman filter to optimize mean-reverting errors in co-integrated stock sets. The strategy outperforms traditional methods and generates better returns in bear markets, making it an effective counter-cyclical strategy.

3. **Correlation Matrix Clustering for Arbitrage Portfolios**:
   - The authors propose a statistical arbitrage strategy using clustering algorithms to partition stocks based on their residual returns' correlation matrix. The method groups stocks into clusters, constructing mean-reverting portfolios that deliver high annualized returns with significant Sharpe ratios.

4. **High-frequency Statistical Arbitrage in Chinese Futures Market**:
   - This paper implements a pairs trading strategy in the Chinese commodity futures market, using cointegration, Kalman filters, and the Hurst index. The strategy yields cumulative returns of 81% within-sample and 21% out-of-sample, demonstrating that the Chinese futures market is not fully efficient.

5. **Intraday Market Arbitrage Using Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)**:
   - This research applies reinforcement learning (A3C) to exploit intraday price differences in electricity markets. The deep reinforcement learning framework optimizes risk-reward ratios, making it useful for autonomous trading in volatile markets like electricity, where traders must close positions by the end of trading sessions.

6. **Arbitrage in China’s Carbon Markets**:
   - This paper explores arbitrage opportunities across regional carbon markets in China using pairs trading. The study finds that arbitrage is profitable, with the Shanghai and Beijing carbon allowances showing the highest annualized returns of 9.11%. Arbitrage signals are mostly triggered during low activity periods in the trading cycle.

7. **Freight Options Market Arbitrage**:
   - Statistical arbitrage in the freight options market exploits the mismatch between historical and implied volatility term structures. The study shows that statistical arbitrage profits exist in the freight options market, revealing inefficiencies that can be systematically exploited for profit.

8. **Reinforcement Learning for Statistical Arbitrage**:
   - This study introduces a reinforcement learning framework for statistical arbitrage by focusing on mean-reverting spreads. It departs from traditional model-based approaches, leveraging empirical mean reversion times and reinforcement learning to optimize trading strategies dynamically.

9. **Electricity Markets Arbitrage with Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C)**:
   - The paper develops statistical arbitrage strategies across short-term electricity markets (day-ahead, continuous intraday, and balancing markets). It uses A2C reinforcement learning agents to forecast prices and make optimal trading decisions, outperforming other benchmarks like A3C.

10. **Statistical Arbitrage in Crude Oil Futures Markets**:
    - This paper applies a hidden Markov model to extend pairs trading strategies in crude oil futures, incorporating Brent, WTI, and Shanghai futures. It reveals that statistical arbitrage is more profitable when the Shanghai futures are included due to their quicker adjustment speed, highlighting inefficiencies in global crude oil markets.

1. **Statistical Arbitrage in Energy Futures (Natural Gas & Electricity)**:
    - This research explores statistical arbitrage in energy futures markets, specifically natural gas and electricity futures. The study shows potential for arbitrage via spark-spread trading, yielding up to 30% in returns, confirming the cointegration between energy prices and profit opportunities.

Each paper explores different markets and strategies, from deep learning in US equities to carbon markets and high-frequency futures trading in China, offering valuable insights into the adaptability and effectiveness of statistical arbitrage strategies across various asset classes.
