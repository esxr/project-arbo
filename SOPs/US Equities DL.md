### **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Deep Learning Statistical Arbitrage in US Equities**

---

#### **Objective**
This SOP provides a structured process for implementing a **high-frequency deep learning-based statistical arbitrage strategy** in the **US equities market**. The strategy involves **pairs trading**, leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transformers** to extract signals from time-series data and optimize for economic objectives such as maximizing **Sharpe Ratio** (>4) and achieving **20% annual return**.

---

#### **Scope**
This SOP is intended for quantitative researchers, data scientists, and algorithmic traders working in **high-frequency trading (HFT)** environments, who are deploying advanced **deep learning** and **economic objective optimization** for statistical arbitrage in US equities.

---

#### **Definitions**
- **Pairs Trading**: A market-neutral strategy involving long and short positions in two correlated assets, designed to profit when their prices revert to an expected spread.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: A type of deep learning model to capture spatial and temporal patterns in time series data.
- **Transformers**: A deep learning model that captures global dependencies in time series data using attention mechanisms, ideal for extracting complex temporal patterns.
- **Factor Models**: Economic models used to explain stock returns based on multiple factors (e.g., Fama-French 5 factors).
- **Economic Objectives**: Metrics to optimize performance, such as maximizing risk-adjusted returns, minimizing transaction costs, and adhering to market constraints.

3. **Data Types**:
   - **Price Data**: Tick-by-tick OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.
   - **Factor Data**: Fama-French 5 factors, market beta, momentum, volatility, and liquidity factors, sourced from **SIX Financial** or **WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services)**.
   - **Order Book Data**: Capture bid-ask depth via **QuantHouse**, which provides **full Level 2 data** (including order flow).

#### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Use **Kx Systems' kdb+** for high-speed data storage and processing of tick data. Its time-series optimized database allows efficient querying and data cleaning.
   - Leverage **OneTick** for cleaning real-time and historical tick data, removing outliers, correcting misreported prices, and handling stock splits.

2. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Use **Nanosecond-Precision Timestamps** from **Thomson Reuters Elektron** or **AlgoSeek** to ensure that all data sources are perfectly aligned in real-time across exchanges.
   
3. **Normalization**:
   - Normalize data using **Z-standardization** techniques in **Python (NumPy/Pandas)** or **Apache Spark** for distributed computation of large datasets.

4. **Storage of Preprocessed Data**:
   - Use **Kdb+/OneTick** for tick data storage and fast retrieval. For deep learning pipelines, use **Google BigQuery** or **Snowflake** for large-scale data management with cloud integration.

#### **Step 3: Portfolio Construction Using Factor Models**
1. **Factor Model Selection**:
   - Implement **Fama-French 5 factor models** using **QuantLib (Python)** or **Matlab** to generate factor-based mimicking portfolios for equities.
   - For advanced multi-factor models, use **Bloomberg's BQuant** platform, which provides built-in functionality to construct factor-based long-short portfolios.

2. **Cointegration Analysis**:
   - Apply **Cointegration Tests** (Engle-Granger or Johansen tests) via **Eikon Python API** from **Refinitiv** or **Matlabâ€™s Econometrics Toolbox** to find cointegrated stock pairs.
   - Use **MATLAB Parallel Server** for large-scale cointegration analysis across hundreds of stock pairs in parallel.

---

#### **Step 4: Deep Learning Model Design**
1. **Signal Extraction Using CNNs**:
   - Build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** to detect short-term patterns in stock residuals. Implement **1D Convolutional Layers** to extract time-series features from residual spreads.
   - Use **TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)** or **GPU acceleration** via **Google Cloud AI** or **NVIDIA DGX Systems** to speed up training on high-frequency data.

2. **Long-Term Dependencies Using Transformers**:
   - Build a **Transformer model** using **Hugging Face Transformers** library for Python. Use attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies and global patterns in residual price series.
   - Leverage **Apache MXNet** with GPU acceleration for handling large datasets and parallelizing computations in real-time financial environments.

3. **Model Integration**:
   - Combine **CNN** and **Transformer models** using **PyTorch Lightning** for seamless integration and modular code. Train the integrated models in a **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** environment to scale across multiple GPUs.
   - Implement **data pipelines** in **Dask** or **Ray** for distributed computing on large-scale, high-frequency time-series data.

#### **Step 5: Training the Model**
1. **Training Data**:
   - Use **rolling-window cross-validation** in **MLflow** or **Weights & Biases** to track experiments and models across different time periods, ensuring generalization of the models.

2. **Loss Function**:
   - Implement a **custom loss function** in TensorFlow or PyTorch that incorporates **Sharpe Ratio optimization** or risk-adjusted return maximization. Use **AdamW optimizer** for fine-tuning model weights.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use **Optuna** or **Hyperopt** for hyperparameter optimization across multiple cloud GPUs (e.g., **Google AI Platform** or **AWS EC2 p3 instances**), focusing on optimizing CNN/Transformer parameters.
