### **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Reinforcement Learning for Statistical Arbitrage in US Equities**

---

#### **Objective**
This SOP outlines the process for implementing a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based statistical arbitrage strategy** in **US equities** using **mean-reversion trading**. The strategy introduces the use of an **empirical mean reversion time metric** to dynamically optimize trading decisions. This approach is designed to be **flexible across various sectors**, leveraging **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to enhance profitability in mean-reverting markets.

---

#### **Scope**
This SOP is intended for quantitative researchers, data scientists, and algorithmic traders developing **reinforcement learning**-based arbitrage strategies for **US equity markets**. The strategy focuses on **sector-based stock pairs** in sectors such as **financials, energy, technology, and healthcare**.

---

#### **Definitions**
- **Mean-Reversion Trading**: A strategy based on the assumption that the price of an asset will revert to its historical mean over time.
- **Empirical Mean Reversion Time**: A measure of how quickly a mean-reverting asset returns to its long-term equilibrium after deviating.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: A machine learning technique where an agent learns to make sequential decisions by maximizing cumulative rewards based on feedback from the environment.
- **Kalman Filter**: A recursive algorithm that estimates variables in noisy environments, often used for dynamically modeling time-varying systems.

### **Procedure**

#### **Step 1: Data Collection**
1. **Target Market**:
   - Focus on **US equities** across multiple sectors (e.g., technology, financials, energy, healthcare).
   - Collect **daily or high-frequency tick data** for the most liquid stocks.

2. **Data Sources**:
   - Use **Bloomberg** or **Refinitiv Eikon** for accessing **historical and real-time stock data**.
   - For **factor data**, leverage **Fama-French 5 factors** and **momentum indicators** from **Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS)**.
   - Gather **sector-level data** for sector-specific pair selection using sources like **Yahoo Finance** or **Thomson Reuters**.

3. **Data Types**:
   - **Price Data**: Daily or tick-by-tick OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) for stocks within the target sectors.
   - **Exogenous Factors**: Macroeconomic data (interest rates, inflation) that impact sector performance.

---

#### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Use **Python (Pandas/NumPy)** or **R** for data cleaning. Remove missing values and handle corporate actions like **stock splits** and **dividends** using **Bloomberg-adjusted data**.
   - Apply **Kalman filtering** for smoothing the data and estimating real-time mean-reversion parameters.

2. **Normalization**:
   - Normalize price data into **log-returns** to eliminate scaling issues and align stock prices for statistical modeling.

3. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Ensure that all datasets are synchronized across sectors and time intervals, particularly when using high-frequency tick data.

---

#### **Step 3: Mean-Reversion Spread Construction**
1. **Pair Selection**:
   - Select stock pairs based on **correlation** or **cointegration analysis**. Use **Engle-Granger tests** to identify cointegrated pairs within sectors.
   - Construct spread portfolios where the price difference exhibits **mean-reverting properties**.

2. **Empirical Mean Reversion Time Calculation**:
   - Calculate the **empirical mean reversion time (r)** using the following formula:
     \[
     r = \frac{2}{N} \sum_{i=2}^{N, i \text{ even}} (\tau_i - \tau_{i-1})
     \]
   - Use **grid search** to find the optimal coefficients for asset pairs that minimize the mean-reversion time【45:0†source】【45:5†source】.

---

#### **Step 4: Reinforcement Learning Model Design**
1. **RL Algorithm**:
   - Implement the **Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)** reinforcement learning algorithm using **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.
   - The A3C model consists of:
     - **Actor**: Determines the optimal action (e.g., buy, sell, hold) based on the current state.
     - **Critic**: Estimates the value function, which evaluates the expected future rewards given the current state and action.

2. **State Space Representation**:
   - Define the state space to include:
     - **Recent price movements** (using a rolling window of the last N days).
     - **Mean reversion signal strength** (calculated from the spread between two stock prices).
     - **Volatility and liquidity metrics**.
     - **Empirical mean reversion time** as an additional feature to optimize trading actions【45:0†source】.

3. **Action Space**:
   - Define the action space as a set of discrete actions (Buy, Sell, Hold).
   - Include **position sizing** based on confidence in the mean-reversion signal.

4. **Reward Function**:
   - Use a reward function that captures the **profit-to-risk ratio**:
     \[
     Reward = \text{Profit} - \lambda \times \text{Risk}
     \]
   - Incorporate transaction costs and market impact into the reward function to penalize excessive trading.

---

#### **Step 5: Model Training and Optimization**
1. **Training Data**:
   - Use historical price data for training the A3C model, splitting the dataset into **training (80%)** and **validation (20%)** sets.
   - Apply **rolling-window backtesting** to simulate out-of-sample performance【45:0†source】【45:2†source】.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimize key hyperparameters such as **learning rate**, **discount factor**, and **exploration rate** using **Bayesian optimization** or **grid search**.

---

#### **Step 6: Live Trading Signal Generation**
1. **Real-Time Signal Generation**:
   - Implement the trained A3C model to generate real-time trading signals based on the current state of the market. Signals should include:
     - **Buy/sell/hold recommendations**.
     - **Position sizing** based on the confidence of the mean-reversion signal.

2. **Execution of Trades**:
   - Use **FIX Protocol** via **Interactive Brokers API** or **Trading Technologies X_TRADER** for automated trade execution.
   - Implement **smart order routing** to optimize trade execution across different venues.

---

#### **Step 7: Risk Management and Monitoring**
1. **Risk Management**:
   - Monitor portfolio risk using **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** or **Expected Shortfall (ES)** metrics.
   - Implement **dynamic stop-losses** that adjust based on volatility and the mean-reversion signal.

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Use **Kx Dashboards** or **Grafana** for real-time performance monitoring. Track key metrics such as **Sharpe ratio**, **drawdown**, and **profitability per sector**.

---

#### **Step 8: Backtesting and Evaluation**
1. **Backtesting Framework**:
   - Perform comprehensive backtesting using **Zipline** or **QuantConnect** to evaluate historical performance and robustness of the RL model under different market conditions.

2. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Evaluate the model based on:
     - **Sharpe Ratio**, **Maximum Drawdown**, and **Annualized Return**.
     - **Empirical mean reversion time** as a secondary evaluation criterion to gauge how efficiently the model trades on mean-reverting signals【45:2†source】【45:0†source】.

#### **Review and Updates**
- This SOP should be reviewed every quarter or when significant changes occur in data availability, market conditions, or model performance. All updates should be managed using **GitHub** or **GitLab** for version control, and integrated into live trading environments via **CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins/Travis CI)** to ensure continuous model improvement and deployment.
