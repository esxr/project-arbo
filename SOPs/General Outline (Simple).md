### **Abstract**

This study investigates the application of **Statistical Arbitrage** as a trading strategy, focusing on exploiting price inefficiencies between financial assets, including stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The primary objective is to utilize advanced statistical techniques to identify deviations in the prices of correlated assets and capitalize on these deviations for profitable trades.

The methodology involves the collection of historical price data for multiple assets and subsequent data exploration to understand their interrelationships. Statistical methods such as **mean reversion** and **cointegration** are employed to detect mispricings. The construction of a predictive model begins with a baseline linear regression and progresses to more sophisticated approaches, including multi-variable regression and ensemble techniques.

The strategy's performance is evaluated through backtesting, which involves simulating the model's effectiveness using historical data. Metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, and risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe Ratio) are used to assess the strategy's performance.

When implemented with real-time data and advanced analytical tools, statistical arbitrage can offer a systematic method to identify and exploit profitable trading opportunities. The success of the strategy largely depends on the predictive model's accuracy, the quality of data utilized, and the timeliness of trade execution.

### **1. Introduction**
#### **Problem Definition and Research Question**

The research seeks to address the following question:

*Can statistical methods be used to identify and exploit price inefficiencies between correlated financial assets (e.g., stocks or ETFs) to generate profitable trading opportunities?*

The objective is to use **statistical arbitrage** to predict price movements and identify potential trades between assets that historically exhibit price co-movements.

### **2. Data Collection**
#### **Data Preparation and Exploration**

For this study, historical price data for a selection of financial assets is required, focusing on assets that often exhibit correlations or have price discrepancies. Suitable datasets include:
- Stock price data from sources such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Kaggle.
- ETF price data.

**Procedure**:
- **Data Acquisition**: Historical data is scraped from reliable sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
- The dataset includes key variables: closing prices, volume, and timestamps.

### **3. Data Exploration and Preparation**
Exploration of the dataset is crucial to understanding asset relationships. Data exploration involves:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Examining the distribution of each asset’s prices over time (e.g., via histograms or line plots).
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Assessing relationships between different assets using scatter plots or correlation matrices.
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Addressing any missing values through interpolation or removal.

**Actions**:
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, normalization of prices).
- Generation of visualizations, including:
  - Line charts displaying price trends over time.
  - Heatmaps showing correlations between asset prices.

### **4. Analysis and Modeling Techniques**
#### **Methodological Approach**

To achieve the study’s objective, two primary statistical approaches are employed:

1. **Mean Reversion Model**:
   - Hypothesis: Asset prices exhibit a tendency to revert to their historical mean over time.
   - Methodology: Rolling means or z-scores are calculated to identify instances where a stock/ETF deviates significantly from its mean, signaling a potential trade.

2. **Cointegration Test**:
   - Hypothesis: Certain pairs of assets move together over the long term.
   - Methodology: Cointegration testing is used to identify pairs of assets whose prices are statistically correlated, even if they diverge over shorter periods.

**Implementation**:
- Application of the **mean reversion** technique to calculate z-scores and identify trade signals based on price deviations.
- Use of **cointegration tests** to identify pairs of assets with long-term statistical relationships, utilizing Python libraries such as `statsmodels`.

### **5. Baseline Model and Improvement**
#### **Model Development and Enhancement**

A baseline model is constructed using **linear regression** to predict asset prices based on historical data. 

**Further Improvements**:
- Advancement from linear regression to **multi-variable regression models** or the incorporation of **machine learning algorithms** (e.g., Random Forests, Support Vector Machines) to predict more complex relationships.

**Actions**:
- Baseline model implementation via linear regression.
- Enhancement through advanced modeling techniques such as **polynomial regression** or **ensemble learning methods** to capture complex inter-asset dynamics.

### **6. Performance Evaluation and Visualization**
#### **Quantitative Metrics and Visualization**

The evaluation of the statistical arbitrage strategy is conducted using various metrics:
- **Accuracy** of buy/sell signals.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to evaluate regression predictions.
- **Sharpe Ratio** to measure risk-adjusted returns.

**Visualizations**:
- Line charts comparing predicted vs. actual price movements.
- A **performance dashboard** displaying metrics such as accuracy and Sharpe Ratio.

### **7. Backtesting**
#### **Historical Performance Simulation**

A fundamental part of this strategy is **backtesting**, wherein the model’s trade signals are simulated against historical data to assess performance and refine the strategy.

**Procedure**:
- Development of a **backtesting framework** that simulates trades based on the model’s buy/sell signals using historical data.
- Measurement of metrics such as **profit/loss**, **win rate**, and **maximum drawdown**.
