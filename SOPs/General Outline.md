### **Step 1: Define the Problem and Propose a Well-Defined Question**

**Question**: 
*"Can temporal price inefficiencies between two or more assets (stocks, ETFs, or commodity futures) be identified and exploited using advanced statistical methods like deep learning-based mean reversion and reinforcement learning?"*

### **Step 2: Data Collection**
Consider using **high-frequency data** from multiple markets. For instance, high-frequency data has been used in futures markets, which often offer better arbitrage opportunities. Additionally, collect **exogenous data** (e.g., volume, volatility, macroeconomic indicators) to enhance predictive capabilities.

**Action**: 
- Collect high-frequency data on stocks, ETFs, or futures contracts, and add exogenous factors to enrich your dataset.
- Use more advanced data sources, such as historical order book data or futures market data, to capture microstructure effects.

### **Step 3: Data Exploration and Preparation**
Recent work highlights using **clustering algorithms** to find co-moving assets and forming arbitrage portfolios based on correlations. A powerful method involves **correlation matrix clustering** using graph-theory-based approaches, which can help group assets that exhibit mean-reverting behavior.

**Action**: 
- Employ graph-based clustering on the correlation matrix of assets to form clusters for statistical arbitrage.
- Apply advanced **Kalman filters** or **adaptive filters** to dynamically adjust predictions, useful for modeling partial co-integration.

### **Step 4: Analysis and Modeling Techniques**
You can enhance the **mean reversion** and **cointegration** models with techniques such as **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** to capture regime-switching behaviors and identify price misalignments more effectively. Moreover, **reinforcement learning** can help optimize trade decisions in real time by learning from past actions and outcomes.

**Action**: 
- Integrate **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** to detect regime shifts and enhance the mean reversion model.
- Use **deep reinforcement learning** (e.g., Advantage Actor-Critic [A2C] or Asynchronous A3C) to develop adaptive trading strategies based on learned market patterns.

### **Step 5: Create a Baseline Model and Improve**
In place of simple linear regression, use **non-parametric methods** and **deep learning** models like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transformers**. These models can capture complex dependencies and interactions in the data. Additionally, **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck** models can still be applied for mean reversion, but reinforcement learning methods offer more dynamic portfolio management.

**Action**: 
- Start with a baseline **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck** model for mean reversion, then improve it using **deep learning** techniques (CNNs or RNNs).
- Incorporate **Reinforcement Learning** (e.g., A3C or A2C) for decision-making based on learned signals.

### **Step 6: Performance Evaluation and Visualization**
Along with traditional metrics like Sharpe Ratio and MSE, evaluate using **drawdown risk** and advanced metrics specific to deep learning models like **reward functions** from reinforcement learning strategies.

**Action**:
- Introduce metrics for evaluating **risk-adjusted returns** under real-world constraints, like drawdown and risk exposure limits.
- Visualize model decisions and returns across different regimes identified by the HMM.

### **Step 7: Backtesting**
For more robust backtesting, use a **rolling-window** approach with **walk-forward optimization**. This technique allows your model to adapt to market changes over time. Additionally, reinforcement learning models can adapt in real time, making them particularly useful for dynamic markets.

**Action**:
- Set up a **reinforcement learning-based backtesting framework** that dynamically updates as it receives new data, allowing for continuous learning and improvement.
- Track returns, risk, and **Sharpe Ratios** while accounting for real-time transaction costs and liquidity constraints.

By incorporating these state-of-the-art methods and models from recent research, your experiment will better reflect current advances in statistical arbitrage trading. You can integrate deep learning and reinforcement learning for smarter and more adaptive decision-making.
