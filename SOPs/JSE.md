### **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Statistical Arbitrage on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Using Partial Cointegration**

---

#### **Objective**
The objective of this SOP is to implement a **statistical arbitrage strategy** on the **Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE)** using **partial cointegration** and **Kalman filtering**. This strategy is particularly designed to improve performance in **bear markets**, outperforming standard co-integration approaches by utilizing sector-based co-integration and partial mean-reverting behavior.

---

#### **Scope**
This SOP is intended for quantitative analysts, data scientists, and algorithmic traders focused on **statistical arbitrage** strategies. The strategy involves trading on the JSE, using **Kalman filters** to model partial cointegration relationships within specific **sector-based stock pairs**.

---

#### **Definitions**
- **Partial Cointegration**: A modified form of cointegration where the error term contains both a mean-reverting component and a random walk, allowing for more flexibility in modeling price relationships.
- **Kalman Filter**: A recursive estimation algorithm that dynamically adjusts model parameters, used to filter out noise and estimate time-varying cointegration relationships in real-time.
- **Sector-Based Co-Integration**: Identifying cointegrated pairs of stocks within the same sector to increase the likelihood of stable, long-term price relationships.
- **Bear Market**: A market condition where prices are falling, typically by 20% or more from recent highs, which creates opportunities for mean-reversion strategies.

---

### **Procedure**

#### **Step 1: Data Collection**
1. **Target Market**:
   - Focus on **high-frequency or daily price data** for stocks listed on the **Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE)**.
   - Select stocks from sectors such as **Financials**, **Industrials**, **Materials**, and **Consumer Goods**.

2. **Data Sources**:
   - **JSE Market Data**: Use data providers like **Bloomberg**, **Refinitiv Eikon**, or **Iress** for accessing JSE historical and real-time price data.
   - **Macroeconomic Data**: Collect macroeconomic indicators relevant to the South African market, such as **GDP growth**, **interest rates**, and **commodity prices**, from sources like **Thomson Reuters Datastream** or **Wind Financial**.

3. **Data Types**:
   - **Price Data**: Historical **OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)** data at daily or tick-level frequency for all selected stocks.
   - **Sector and Fundamental Data**: Sector-level data and key company financials (e.g., P/E ratio, market cap) to support sector-based cointegration.

---

#### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Use **Kx Systems' kdb+** or **OneTick** for efficient storage and processing of high-frequency data. Clean the data by removing anomalies (e.g., incorrect ticks) and filling missing values.
   - Adjust for **corporate actions** like stock splits and dividends using **Bloomberg Terminal** or **Refinitiv Eikon** adjustments.

2. **Normalization and Time Alignment**:
   - Normalize price data by converting it to **log-returns** using **Python (Pandas/NumPy)** for statistical stability.
   - Align price data with macroeconomic indicators and other exogenous data using **nanosecond-precision timestamps** from **Iress** or **Bloomberg**.

3. **Storage of Preprocessed Data**:
   - Store cleaned and preprocessed data in a high-performance database such as **Apache HBase** or **kdb+**, ensuring rapid access for model training and real-time trading.

---

#### **Step 3: Partial Cointegration Analysis**
1. **Partial Cointegration Testing**:
   - Perform **Engle-Granger** or **Johansen cointegration tests** using **R (urca package)** or **Python (Statsmodels)** to find cointegrated stock pairs within each sector.
   - Use **Clegg and Krauss’s approach** to model partial cointegration, identifying residuals that exhibit both a **mean-reverting component** and a **random walk**【16†source】.

2. **Kalman Filter Implementation for Partial Cointegration**:
   - Implement **Kalman filters** using **QuantLib (C++)** or **Python (PyKalman)** to estimate time-varying cointegration relationships between stock pairs.
   - The Kalman filter will adjust the estimated spread in real time, accounting for the **random walk component** in partial cointegration models【16†source】.

3. **Sector-Based Co-Integration**:
   - Focus on finding cointegration relationships within the same sector, such as pairs of **banks** or **mining companies**, to enhance the stability of cointegration【16†source】.
   - Automate sector-based cointegration analysis using **MATLAB Parallel Server** or **Dask (Python)** for parallel processing across multiple sectors and stock pairs.

---

#### **Step 4: Spread Calculation and Signal Generation**
1. **Spread Calculation**:
   - Use the residuals from the Kalman filter as the **spread** between two partially cointegrated stocks. The spread represents the deviation from the long-term equilibrium relationship.

2. **Trading Signal Generation**:
   - Establish **entry thresholds** based on the deviation of the spread from its mean (e.g., when the spread moves 2 standard deviations away from the mean).
   - Use **Python (Scikit-learn)** or **MATLAB** to implement machine learning-based classifiers that enhance signal generation by identifying optimal entry and exit points.

3. **Stop-Loss and Risk Management**:
   - Set dynamic **stop-loss** levels based on volatility-adjusted risk measures to minimize exposure during non-reverting periods.
   - Use **VaR (Value-at-Risk)** models from **QuantLib** or **Python (PyPortfolioOpt)** for portfolio-level risk management.

---

#### **Step 5: Backtesting and Performance Evaluation**
1. **Backtesting Framework**:
   - Use **QuantConnect** or **Zipline** to backtest the partial cointegration strategy on historical JSE data, simulating trades based on real-world conditions.
   - Implement **walk-forward optimization** in **Python (Backtrader)** to optimize the strategy’s performance across different market regimes, especially focusing on **bear markets**.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Track key metrics such as **Sharpe Ratio**, **Annualized Return**, **Maximum Drawdown**, and **Calmar Ratio** to evaluate strategy performance.
   - Compare the results of the partial cointegration strategy with a **standard co-integration model** to quantify the improvement in performance, particularly during **bear markets**【16†source】.

---

#### **Step 6: Live Trading Implementation**
1. **Trade Execution System**:
   - Implement the live strategy using **FIX Protocol** for low-latency execution through **Trading Technologies (TT)** or **CQG** platforms, ensuring real-time execution of trades on the JSE.
   - Integrate **TT Autospreader** for managing long-short pairs trading strategies in real time across partially cointegrated stock pairs.

2. **Real-Time Data Monitoring**:
   - Monitor real-time spread dynamics using **Kx Dashboards** or **Grafana**, ensuring that all deviations from the cointegration equilibrium are captured accurately for trade execution.

3. **Dynamic Rebalancing**:
   - Implement **real-time rebalancing algorithms** in **Python** using **Dask** or **Ray** to dynamically adjust positions based on changing spreads and market conditions.

---

#### **Step 7: Continuous Improvement and Learning**
1. **Machine Learning for Optimization**:
   - Use **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** with the **A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) algorithm** in **Ray RLlib** to continuously optimize entry/exit points based on evolving market dynamics.
   - Train models on both historical and real-time data to ensure they adapt to changing market conditions and improve decision-making over time.

2. **Model Update and Review**:
   - Regularly retrain models using **H2O.ai** or **TensorFlow** to improve predictive accuracy as new data becomes available. Use **Grid Search** and **Bayesian optimization** for hyperparameter tuning to optimize Kalman filter and cointegration model settings.

#### **Review and Updates**
- This SOP should be reviewed every six months or when significant changes in market conditions, strategy performance, or data sources occur. Updates should be tracked using **GitHub** or **GitLab** for version control, ensuring all changes are well-documented and integrated into the live trading strategy using **CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, Travis CI)**.
