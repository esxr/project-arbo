### **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for High-Frequency Statistical Arbitrage in Chinese Commodity Futures**

---

#### **Objective**
This SOP outlines the steps for implementing a **high-frequency statistical arbitrage strategy** in the **Chinese commodity futures market**. The strategy focuses on **pairs trading**, utilizing **cointegration**, **Kalman filters**, and the **Hurst index** with advanced filtering techniques such as machine learning filters. The goal is to achieve **81% in-sample returns** and **21% out-of-sample returns** using high-frequency trading technologies.

---

#### **Scope**
This SOP is for quantitative researchers, data scientists, and traders specializing in **high-frequency trading (HFT)**, particularly those who are implementing **machine learning-based statistical arbitrage strategies** in Chinese commodity futures markets.

---

#### **Definitions**
- **Pairs Trading**: A statistical arbitrage strategy where two co-moving assets are traded (one long, one short) based on the expectation of their prices reverting to their historical relationship.
- **Cointegration**: A statistical property of two or more time series where a linear combination of them is stationary, implying a long-term equilibrium.
- **Kalman Filter**: A recursive algorithm that estimates time-varying variables from noisy observations, used to dynamically adjust model parameters.
- **Hurst Index**: A measure of the long-term memory of a time series, used to identify mean-reverting behavior.
- **Machine Learning Filters**: Adaptive filtering techniques using deep learning models to enhance signal processing from noisy time-series data.

### **Procedure**

#### **Step 1: Data Collection**
1. **Target Market**:
   - Focus on **high-frequency tick-level data** for **Chinese commodity futures**, primarily from exchanges like the **Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE)** and **Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE)**.
   - Prioritize liquid commodities such as **crude oil**, **copper**, **iron ore**, and **soybeans**.

2. **Data Sources**:
   - **Wind Financial Terminal**: For real-time and historical high-frequency data (tick-level) with full coverage of Chinese commodity futures.
   - **Refinitiv (Eikon)** or **Thomson Reuters Elektron**: For accessing real-time futures data streams with low latency and comprehensive historical futures data.
   - **CQG Data Factory**: Provides accurate, tick-by-tick data with full depth-of-market order book information for commodity futures in China.

3. **Data Types**:
   - **Tick-by-tick data**: Capture **OHLCV** (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) and **bid/ask prices**.
   - **Order Book Data**: Obtain **Level 2 data** with real-time order book depth from **CQG** or **Wind Financial**.
   - **Macroeconomic Indicators**: Gather macroeconomic data affecting commodity prices from **Wind Financial** or **Bloomberg**.

---

#### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Use **Kx Systems' kdb+** to store and process tick-level data with ultra-low latency. Clean the data by removing outliers, correcting erroneous price ticks, and filling missing values using interpolation methods.
   - **OneTick** can be used for real-time streaming data normalization, outlier detection, and missing value handling.

2. **Normalization and Time Alignment**:
   - Normalize price data into **log-returns** using **Python (NumPy/Pandas)** or **R** for ease of modeling and comparison across commodities.
   - Align all data sources on the same **time horizon** (tick-level synchronization) using **Thomson Reuters Elektron** or **CQG** timestamping for high-frequency data.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Store preprocessed data in **HDF5** format for efficient access during model training.
   - Use **Google Cloud Bigtable** or **MongoDB** for managing large volumes of high-frequency data in distributed environments.

---

#### **Step 3: Cointegration Analysis**
1. **Cointegration Testing**:
   - Use **MATLAB Econometrics Toolbox** or **R (urca package)** to perform **Johansen or Engle-Granger cointegration tests** on pairs of futures to identify long-term equilibrium relationships.
   - Automate cointegration testing across multiple pairs using **Python (Statsmodels)** or **MATLAB Parallel Server** for parallelized computation.

2. **Kalman Filter Implementation**:
   - Apply **Kalman filtering** using **C++ with QuantLib** or **Python (PyKalman)** for real-time adjustments to cointegration relationships and residuals. The Kalman filter will dynamically adjust parameters as new price data arrives.

3. **Spread Estimation**:
   - Use **Quantlib** to calculate the **mean-reverting spread** between two cointegrated futures. Automate spread monitoring and compute real-time signals for pairs trading.

---

#### **Step 4: Hurst Index Calculation and Filtering**
1. **Hurst Index Calculation**:
   - Use **Python (hurst package)** or **MATLAB** to compute the **Hurst exponent** for the spread between cointegrated pairs. The Hurst index helps identify whether the spread is mean-reverting (H < 0.5).
   
2. **Adaptive Hurst Index Filtering**:
   - Implement **adaptive Hurst filtering** using **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)** or **LSTM models** in **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** to dynamically adjust the Hurst index based on changing market conditions. These models will adapt to fluctuations in spread behavior and predict the likelihood of mean reversion.

---

#### **Step 5: Machine Learning Filters for Signal Extraction**
1. **Deep Learning Signal Processing**:
   - Implement **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** to detect short-term patterns in the spread between pairs of futures. Use CNNs to filter out market noise from high-frequency price data.
   - Combine CNNs with **Attention Mechanisms** in **Transformers** to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term price patterns in futures contracts.

2. **Reinforcement Learning for Signal Optimization**:
   - Deploy **Reinforcement Learning (RL) models** using the **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)** method in **Ray RLlib** for optimizing trade entry and exit decisions based on filtered signals. This allows dynamic decision-making based on real-time market conditions and mean-reversion probabilities.

---

#### **Step 6: Trading Signal Generation**
1. **Entry and Exit Signals**:
   - Use the residual from the Kalman-filtered spread and the Hurst-filtered signal to trigger trades. A **mean-reversion signal** is generated when the spread exceeds 2 standard deviations from its long-term mean.
   - Implement trade logic via **FIX Protocol** for low-latency execution, integrated with **TT Platform (X_TRADER)** or **CQG API**.

2. **Stop-Loss and Risk Management**:
   - Set up **dynamic stop-losses** using **CQG Integrated Client API** or **Trading Technologies** to monitor spreads and automatically exit positions when the market deviates from the expected reversion.
   - Dynamically adjust position sizes based on volatility and risk metrics using **PyPortfolioOpt** in Python.

---

#### **Step 7: Backtesting and Performance Evaluation**
1. **Backtesting Framework**:
   - Conduct backtests on historical tick data using **QuantConnect** or **Zipline** to simulate strategy performance under realistic market conditions. Evaluate the strategy for **81% in-sample and 21% out-of-sample returns**.
   - Use **Dask** or **Ray** for distributed processing of backtesting across multiple commodity futures pairs, enabling fast computation of large datasets.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Track key metrics such as **Sharpe Ratio**, **Maximum Drawdown**, **Profit-to-Loss Ratio**, and **Alpha** using **PyFolio** or **MATLAB Financial Toolbox**. Ensure that the strategy maintains a high Sharpe ratio while minimizing risk.

---

#### **Step 8: Live Trading Implementation**
1. **Live Trading Execution**:
   - Deploy the strategy in a live trading environment using **Trading Technologies' TT FIX API** or **CQG's Continuum API** for real-time order execution.
   - Use **TT Autospreader** to manage pairs trading strategies in real-time, ensuring optimal execution of long and short positions across futures contracts.

2. **Monitoring and Performance Tracking**:
   - Set up **Grafana** or **Datadog** dashboards for real-time monitoring of model performance, trading signals, and P&L.
   - Set **automated alerts** via **Slack or PagerDuty integration** to notify the trading team when performance deviates from expected thresholds or risk limits.

#### **Review and Updates**
- This SOP should be reviewed and updated every quarter or when significant changes in market conditions, model performance, or data sources occur. Updates should be documented and shared across the team using **Git (GitHub or GitLab)** for version control and integrated into the **CI/CD pipeline** with **Jenkins** or **CircleCI** to ensure continuous deployment and improvement of the live trading strategy.
