### **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Electricity Markets Arbitrage Using A2C**

---

#### **Objective**
This SOP outlines the procedure for implementing a **reinforcement learning (RL)-based statistical arbitrage strategy** using the **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)** algorithm in **European electricity markets**. The strategy focuses on **price arbitrage across day-ahead, intraday, and balancing markets** while leveraging **autoencoders** and **generative adversarial networks (GANs)** to enhance forecasting and decision-making.

---

#### **Scope**
This SOP is designed for quantitative researchers, data scientists, and algorithmic traders involved in **electricity market arbitrage**. It covers the application of **A2C reinforcement learning** in **price forecasting** and **trading decisions** across **short-term electricity markets** such as day-ahead, continuous intraday (CID), and balancing (BAL) markets.

---

#### **Definitions**
- **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)**: A reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes policy and value functions by reducing the variance of gradient updates through advantage estimation.
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks used to compress input data into lower-dimensional representations and reconstruct it. Used here for data augmentation.
- **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**: A machine learning model where two networks (generator and discriminator) are trained simultaneously, often used for data augmentation and forecasting enhancement.
- **Day-Ahead Market (DAM)**: An auction-based market where electricity is traded a day in advance.
- **Continuous Intraday Market (CID)**: A market where electricity can be traded continuously up to one hour before delivery.
- **Balancing Market (BAL)**: A market where imbalances in supply and demand are settled in real-time during the delivery period.

### **Procedure**

#### **Step 1: Data Collection**
1. **Target Markets**:
   - Focus on European electricity markets, specifically the **Day-Ahead (DAM)**, **Intraday (CID)**, and **Balancing (BAL)** markets.

2. **Data Sources**:
   - **ENTSO-E Transparency Platform**: Provides market data on day-ahead prices, cross-border flows, and demand forecasts.
   - **EPEX SPOT** and **Nord Pool**: Access to intraday and day-ahead market data, including limit order book (LOB) information.
   - **Balancing Market Data**: Obtain real-time imbalance prices and volumes from **ENTSO-E** or **national TSOs (Transmission System Operators)**.

3. **Data Types**:
   - **Day-Ahead Prices**: Hourly DAM prices for multiple European countries.
   - **Intraday Limit Order Book (LOB) Data**: Full order book depth (top N levels of bids/asks).
   - **Balancing Prices**: Real-time price data for imbalance settlements.

---

#### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Use **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** or **Apache Spark** to handle missing values, remove anomalies, and adjust for outliers in high-frequency electricity market data.
   - Normalize time-series data to ensure consistent scaling across different price points and markets.

2. **Autoencoders for Data Augmentation**:
   - Implement **autoencoders** using **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** to augment price data and fill in missing patterns, especially for DAM and intraday price series.
   - Train the autoencoder on historical price data to improve **forecast accuracy** by reconstructing missing or incomplete sequences .

3. **GANs for Enhanced Price Forecasting**:
   - Use **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to augment training data for price prediction models. Implement **Wasserstein GANs (WGAN)** with a gradient penalty to generate synthetic data that mimics electricity price behavior .
   - GANs will help simulate price variations and improve prediction performance by introducing artificial market conditions.

---

#### **Step 3: Feature Engineering**
1. **Technical Indicators for DAM Forecasting**:
   - Introduce **technical indicators** such as **moving averages**, **Bollinger bands**, and **RSI** to improve the forecasting of **day-ahead market prices**. These indicators help capture market trends and volatility .

2. **Engineered Features for CID Forecasting**:
   - Extract novel features from the **limit order book (LOB)** for CID price forecasting, such as **order imbalance**, **top-of-book bid-ask spread**, and **depth ratio** .
   - Use these features as inputs into machine learning models to predict intraday price movements.

---

#### **Step 4: A2C Model Design**
1. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm**:
   - Implement **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)** in **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** to manage trading decisions across multiple markets (DAM, CID, BAL). The **Actor** component optimizes the trading policy, and the **Critic** estimates the value of actions.
   - Integrate **gradient clipping** and **reward shaping** to stabilize the learning process  .

2. **State Space Representation**:
   - Define the state space to include:
     - **Price data** (from DAM, CID, and BAL).
     - **Order book features** from CID.
     - **Price spread between markets** (DAM and CID, CID and BAL).
     - **Historical price trends** from autoencoder-augmented data.
   
3. **Action Space**:
   - The action space will include:
     - **Buy**, **Sell**, or **Hold** decisions for each market (DAM, CID, BAL).
     - Position sizing and balancing based on confidence in arbitrage opportunities across markets.

4. **Reward Function**:
   - The reward function should account for both **profit** and **risk**:
     \[
     R_t = P_t - \lambda \times \text{Risk}_t
     \]
   - Incorporate **trading costs**, **market volatility**, and **risk constraints** into the reward function to encourage prudent decision-making  .

---

#### **Step 5: Model Training**
1. **Training Environment**:
   - Train the A2C model using historical market data across the DAM, CID, and BAL. Use **distributed training** on **GPU clusters (AWS EC2 p3 instances)** or **Google Cloud AI Platform** for scalability.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimize the model by adjusting **learning rates**, **discount factors**, and **exploration rates**. Use **Optuna** or **Ray Tune** for hyperparameter optimization .

3. **Behavior Cloning for Exploration**:
   - Incorporate **behavior cloning** to guide the model in exploring more profitable actions early in the training process. This involves training the agent using historical expert actions to bootstrap learning .

---

#### **Step 6: Real-Time Execution**
1. **Trading Signal Generation**:
   - Use the trained A2C model to generate **real-time buy/sell/hold signals** for electricity trading across DAM, CID, and BAL markets.

2. **Smart Order Execution**:
   - Implement **FIX Protocol** via **Trading Technologies X_TRADER API** or **CQG** for low-latency execution across multiple exchanges.
   - Ensure efficient execution by integrating **smart order routing (SOR)** to optimize trade placement in high-liquidity market periods .

---

#### **Step 7: Performance Evaluation**
1. **Backtesting**:
   - Conduct backtests on historical data using **QuantConnect** or **Zipline** to evaluate the profitability of the A2C strategy across various market conditions .

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Track metrics such as **Sharpe Ratio**, **maximum drawdown**, and **profitability per hour**. Compare results against benchmarks like A3C and traditional arbitrage methods to ensure superior performance  .

#### **Review and Updates**
- This SOP should be reviewed quarterly or after significant market changes, model performance deviations, or technological advancements in reinforcement learning. All updates should be managed through **Git (GitHub/GitLab)** and deployed using **CI/CD pipelines** like **Jenkins** for continuous model integration and improvement.
